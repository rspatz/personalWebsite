    <h3>McDonald's, Montgomery IL, June 2019 to Present</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cleaned the lobby: swept and mopped floors, swept and mopped both entrances,
            cleaned windows, wiped off tables and wood trim, cleaned glass divider, 
            cleaned food trays, kept garbage cans empty, cleaned restrooms, cleaned 
            and stocked drink station.</li>
        <li>By the second day on the job, both Hiring Manager and Store Manager said 
            that work was outstanding; both stated that customers had been complaining 
            but were now complimenting the cleanliness of the restaurant.</li>
        <li>Dozens of customers have complimented work, thanked me for providing a much 
            cleaner lobby, and left high scores for cleanliness of restaurant in McDonald’s 
            surveys. Have been told more than once that the Boulder Hill location is 
            considered to have the cleanest McDonald’s lobby in the area now.</li>
        <li>One customer stated that he has been coming to the restaurant daily 
            for years and has watched many people cleaning the lobby- said that 
            my work is by far the best. Another customer told me that when I 
            cleaned the lobby, it was “spotless.”</li>
        <li>After a fire at this location, worked at the McDonald’s on Route 34 
            (Ogden Avenue location). Cleaned lobby to the same level as the 
            Boulder Hill lobby- management has kept cleanliness level up. 
            Management commented that I have good customer service 
            skills and that I am very friendly with customers.</li>
        <li>Taken orders on both the registers and the kiosks, and assisted 
            customers in using kiosks- taught myself to use the kiosks 
            the second week on the job, and have helped several 
            customers learn to use the kiosks themselves. 
            Have logged dozens of hours on the kiosks 
            and on the registers at the front counter.</li>
    </ul>
